# Deliverable 3 Summary

This model is deployed on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/joshua-gottlieb/tensorflow-credibility_predictor-v1/tree/main

The data was downloaded using [Data-from-Github.ipnyb](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Chatbot-Credibility-Scorer/blob/main/src/deliverable-03/Data-From-Github.ipynb) and saved as [prompts_and_ratings.csv](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Chatbot-Credibility-Scorer/blob/main/src/deliverable-03/prompts_and_ratings.csv).

The primary notebook for the Tensorflow model can be found at [Tensorflow Evaluator.ipynb](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Chatbot-Credibility-Scorer/blob/main/src/deliverable-03/Tensorflow-Evaluator.ipynb). The user prompts are first transformed into 48 dimensional vectors using the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from SentenceTransformers with binary precision. The model was trained for 80 epochs, each of which was saved in [checkpoint/](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Chatbot-Credibility-Scorer/tree/main/src/deliverable-03/checkpoint). The best performing model (epoch 30), based on validation accuracy, was extracted and saved in [saved_model/](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Chatbot-Credibility-Scorer/tree/main/src/deliverable-03/saved_model), along with the pickled tokenizer used to embed the user prompts.

A variety of neural nets were tested. Starting with more neurons (4096) and halving at each step made the model too complex and caused it to heavily overfit on the training data. Starting at fewer neurons (64-128) made the model too simple and led to underfitting and poor performance. Longer neural nets with more layers tended to causes the model to plateau on some sort of vanishing gradient, as it would stop learning after the first few epochs. The final model that had the best performance without heavily overfitting started at 256 neurons and was 4 layers long, halving the number of neurons every two layers. Thus, the layers had 256, 128, 128, and 64 neurons respectively. This architecture obtained a maximum validation accuracy of 70.49%.
