    "- The scraper fails to pick up the correct text on the page frequently, resulting in many misclassified and poor scores. This indicates a need to improve the scraping process.\n",
    "- Webpages with lots of text are being unncessarily penalized due to increased differences between the user prompt vector and the webpage content vector, because as the size of the webpage content increases, the keywords from the user prompt become more sparse.\n",
    "- Even strong websites are being rated between 40 and 70 out of 100. If a website is highly relevant, these scores should be closer to 80-90+; conservative scoring is obscuring the true credibility of the website.\n",
    "- Websites with no text scraped should have content relevance scores that are 0; however, because cosine similarity requires vectors to be orthogonal to produce an output of zero (and the zero vector has no direction so it is not orthogonal), they are currently given low, albeit nonzero scores. Websites that cannot be scraped should not exit the entire process and should instead just exclude the Content Relevance check, scoring on as many attributes as they can."
