       "'The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI\\'s tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be \"taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.”  Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration\\'s four-year crackdown on China\\'s AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they\\'re able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model \"AI\\'s Sputnik moment.\" Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI\\'s o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

       "'Editor\\'s note: For the latest updates on the 2023Â\\xa0coronavirus outbreak, see our news coverage. COVID-19Â\\xa0is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, Â\\xa0the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type ofÂ\\xa0coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. Â\\xa0It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe andÂ\\xa0lungs). It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly. SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren\\'t a serious threat to otherwise healthy people. Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2? Yes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus.Â\\xa0 Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: How long will the coronavirus last? There\\'s no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public\\'s efforts to slow the spread, researchers\\' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of theÂ\\xa0vaccines. The main symptoms include: The virus can lead toÂ\\xa0pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems,Â\\xa0septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs.Â\\xa0In some cases, lung transplants have been needed. If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away: Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST: If you\\'re infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person. According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19: Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19Â\\xa0also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries. What to do if you think you have it If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading: For more information about COVID-19,Â\\xa0see our FAQ. How do I know if it\\'s COVID-19, a cold, or the flu? Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to aÂ\\xa0bad coldÂ\\xa0or the flu. Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if: Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19 COVID-19 (can range from moderate to severe) Â\\xa0 Â\\xadÂ\\xad \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOVID-19 SYMPTOM CHECKER\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n See what to do about your symptoms and whether to call a doctor Is COVID-19 worse than the flu? Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren\\'t immune to the coronavirus, and because it has been mutating with new strains. If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies. Researchers are looking at whether the antibodiesÂ\\xa0give you protection against catching it again. The coronavirus has caused higher rates of severe illness and death than the flu. But the symptoms themselves can vary widely from person to person. Is COVID-19 seasonal like the flu? While scientists hoped initially thatÂ\\xa0higher temperatures and humidity levels might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, that was not the case. Experts advise caution and say thorough public health efforts have more influence than weather on the spread.Â\\xa0 Also, past flu pandemics have happened year-round. Researchers aren\\'t sure what caused it, and investigations as to its origin are ongoing. There\\'s more than one type of coronavirus. They\\'re common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats. Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness. You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions: Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include: Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids\\' blood vessels. If you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19. That said, having schizophrenia is the biggest risk factor for besides age for COVID mortality. Those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are prone to metabolic syndrome, which includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and is associated with systemic inflammation. All of which is exacerbated by COVID. Mood and anxiety disorders were not connected to the higher risk, but people living with mental health conditions may have certain symptoms that can interfere with their ability to care for themselves and be engaged in their health decisions. This can make it hard to effectively follow health behaviors like maintaining social distancing or staying in quarantine to reduce the spread of the infection. Moreover, people with mental health and mood disorders are also more likelyÂ\\xa0to have conditions like diabetes and heart problems which are major risk factors for severe COVID-19. There are also several socio-economic reasons why preexisting mood disorders can increase your chances of hospitalization and death if you get COVID-19.This includes: How does COVID-19 spread? COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person.Â\\xa0People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection.Â\\xa0The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.Â\\xa0The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours. The risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infectious source where the concentration of these very fine droplets and particles is greatest. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don\\'t have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus. While less likely, you can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on. OVID-19 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces: That\\'s why it\\'s important to wash or sanitize your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus. Some dogs and cats have tested positive for the virus. A few have shown signs of illness. There\\'s no evidence that humans can catch this coronavirus from an animal, but it appears it can be passed from humans to animals. What is community spread? Doctors and health officials use this term when they don\\'t know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven\\'tÂ\\xa0been exposed to someoneÂ\\xa0who has COVID-19. In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It\\'s likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn\\'t know it. This type of occurrence has been happening with the variants as well. How fast is it spreading? The number of people infected or re-infected by COVID-19 changes every day. See our news story for the latest updates on this developing story. How contagious is the coronavirus? The transmission rate is relatively high. Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to between 2 and 3.5 others. By comparison, one person who has the seasonal flu will pass it to between 1.1 and 2.3 others. The Omicron variant, which is now the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, is highly contagious and spreads faster than the original virus.Â\\xa0 The CDC reports there is evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted if you get within 6 feet of someone who is infectious for a total of 15 minutes throughout a day.Â\\xa0 We can work to lower the transmission rate byÂ\\xa0wearing high-quality face masks when we can\\'t stay 6 feet away from others,Â\\xa0washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other people, and getting vaccinated. Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food? You\\'re much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you\\'re in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can. If you do your own shopping, wear a high-quality face mask and try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home. The coronavirus can linger on hard surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags has touched. You can wipe down plastic, metal, or glass packaging with soap and water if you want. There\\'s no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers. Call your doctor or local health department if you think you\\'ve been exposed and have symptoms like: Home testing has advanced considerably since the beginning of the pandemic and you can readily test yourself.Â\\xa0Otherwise, testing facilities are readily available in most areas.Â\\xa0While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up. Home testing kits are also widely available. A swab test is the most common testing method. It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. You or the person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes. If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn\\'t enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed. The FDA has granted authorizations for several at-home nasal swab tests, which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis as well as at-home rapid tests. You can buy these over the counter in pharmacies, at retail stores, or online.Â\\xa0At-home tests are also available for free at some local health departments or federally qualified health centers. A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment. But you may also consider taking an antibody testÂ\\xa0which can show whether you\\'ve ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn\\'t have symptoms. This is important in officials\\' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who\\'s immune to the virus. The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps: There\\'s no proof that herbal therapies and teas can prevent infection. COVID-19 preparation tips In addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can: Can aÂ\\xa0face maskÂ\\xa0protect you from infection? A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of vaccines and social distancing efforts. You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don\\'t know that you have it or if you aren\\'t showing signs of infection. It\\'s important to wear a high-quality mask in a variety of situations: Wear a mask indoors in public places if you\\'re in an area where there\\'s a high or â\\x80\\x9csubstantialâ\\x80\\x9d amount of COVID spreading around. That goes for people 2 years old and up.Â\\xa0 If you have a chronic health condition or you\\'re taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you\\'re fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don\\'t need to wear a mask outside, where it\\'s harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren\\'t fully vaccinated. Anyone should wear a face mask if they\\'re sick and around other people or animals, even at home. Caregivers should use them when cleaning and disinfecting a sick person\\'s bedroom or bathroom. If you need to call 911, put on a mask before medical help arrives. Some people shouldn\\'t wear masks: What are the different types of face masks? You have several options: Cloth masks are washable and reusable. The best ones have multiple layers of breathable fabric and fit snugly over your nose and mouth. It\\'s a good idea to buy ones that come with a nose wire and are made with fabric that can block light. Disposable masks, also called surgical masks, are also widely available. Choose ones that have several layers of non-woven material. Pick a size that fits properly over your nose and mouth and comes with a nose wire. Don\\'t wear one that has gaps around the sides of your face or nose, or has wet or dirty material. N95 respirator masksÂ\\xa0fit tightly around your face and filter out 95% or more of the smallest particles in the air.Â\\xa0 It\\'s fine to buy a basic, disposable N95 respirator. Choose one that\\'s high quality and says â\\x80\\x9cNIOSH Approvedâ\\x80\\x9d on the label. Is it safe to travel during a pandemic? Crowded places can raise your chances of getting COVID-19. Itâ\\x80\\x99s important to check the status of COVID-19 transmissions in the area where you travel before you go and take the necessary precautions while there. A few questions may help you decide whether it\\'s safe to travel: If you choose to travel, stay away from sick people. Wash your hands often, and try not to touch your face. Wear a high-quality cloth face mask when you are around other people.Â\\xa0 How can you help stop the spread of the coronavirus? Because the virus spreads from person to person, it\\'s important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible.Â\\xa0and avoid large gatherings. Most states and cities have lifted restrictions but this doesn\\'t mean the virus is gone. Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a high-quality cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands. The following terms have now become commonplace: Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated. There are fourÂ\\xa0vaccines,Â\\xa0which have been granted FDA approval; Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson.Â\\xa0 Pfizer and Moderna have developed bivalent boosters, which are so named because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 Top health experts have a preference for the type of vaccine that you choose. They recommend that you choose a vaccine made with mRNA (like the ones from Pfizer and Moderna) or DNA like Noravax rather than the J&J vaccine, which is made differently. The recommendation is endorsed by the CDC and comes from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which reviewed the latest evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and rare side effects of the available vaccines. That said, receiving any COVID-19 vaccine is better than being unvaccinated, experts say. Booster shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for everyone 5 years and older at least 2 months after you\\'ve gotten your first two doses.Â\\xa0 When it comes to boosters, you don\\'t have to stick with same the vaccine you initially got. For example, if your initial doses came from Moderna, you can get a booster dose from Pfizer. COVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed,Â\\xa0with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculationsÂ\\xa0are safe. The CDC has said it is safe forÂ\\xa0pregnantÂ\\xa0women and there\\'s no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy. There\\'s no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control. Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. But don\\'t give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19. You might have heard that you shouldn\\'t take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual. Antibiotics won\\'t help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. In January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.Â\\xa0 Many clinical trials are underway to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones. A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, and allergic reactions. More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted. Is there a cure for the coronavirus? There\\'s no cure yet, but researchers are working hard to find one. Every case is different. You may have mild flu-like symptoms for a few days after exposure, then get better. But some cases can be severe or fatal. Symptoms can also linger for weeks, even if they\\'re mild. More than a third of people older than 18 who have signs of the virus aren\\'t totally recovered 2 or 3 weeks later, according to a CDC survey. Fatigue and cough were the symptoms that were most likely to linger. Some other people who\\'ve had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. They may have brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness. What is the recovery rate for coronavirus? Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries. But they don\\'t have information about the outcome of every infection. Early estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate will be between 97% and 99.75%. Can you get the coronavirus multiple times? Yes. This is another reason to stay vigilant against becoming infected and transmitting the virus.Â\\xa0 As with other coronaviruses that only causeÂ\\xa0colds, you have a period that you\\'re immune, but that goes away over time.Â\\xa0That also appears to be the case with this coronavirus. Immunity is estimated to last up to three months. Having COVID-19 usually results in antibodies which should help protect you from re-infection. But the virus continues to mutate and these changes can lead to new variants which allow the risk for re-infection. The CDC is investigating how often reinfections occur, who is at higher risk of reinfection, how soon reinfections take place after a previous infection, and the severity of reinfections compared with initial infections.Â\\xa0 Are coronaviruses new? Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, regular coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time. The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including a runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won\\'t know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as a rhinovirus. You treat this kind of coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold.

    "- The scraper fails to pick up the correct text on the page frequently, resulting in many misclassified and poor scores. This indicates a need to improve the scraping process.\n",
    "- Webpages with lots of text are being unncessarily penalized due to increased differences between the user prompt vector and the webpage content vector, because as the size of the webpage content increases, the keywords from the user prompt become more sparse.\n",
    "- Even strong websites are being rated between 40 and 70 out of 100. If a website is highly relevant, these scores should be closer to 80-90+; conservative scoring is obscuring the true credibility of the website.\n",
    "- Websites with no text scraped should have content relevance scores that are 0; however, because cosine similarity requires vectors to be orthogonal to produce an output of zero (and the zero vector has no direction so it is not orthogonal), they are currently given low, albeit nonzero scores. Websites that cannot be scraped should not exit the entire process and should instead just exclude the Content Relevance check, scoring on as many attributes as they can."
